DLT (direct linear transform) algorithm for camera calibration

This is typically used for calibrating cameras and requires a minimum of 6
corresponding pairs of 2D and 3D locations.

## Testing

### Unit tests

To run the unit tests:

```
cargo test
```

### Test for `no_std`

Since the `thumbv7em-none-eabihf` target does not have `std` available, we
can build for it to check that our crate does not inadvertently pull in std.
The unit tests require std, so cannot be run on a `no_std` platform. The
following will fail if a std dependency is present:

```
# install target with: "rustup target add thumbv7em-none-eabihf"
cargo build --no-default-features --target thumbv7em-none-eabihf
```

## Example

```rust
use dlt::{dlt_corresponding, CorrespondingPoint};
use cam_geom::{Camera, Points};

let points: Vec<CorrespondingPoint<f64>> = vec![
    CorrespondingPoint {
        object_point: [-1., -2., -3.],
        image_point: [219.700, 39.400],
    },
    CorrespondingPoint {
        object_point: [0., 0., 0.],
        image_point: [320.000, 240.000],
    },
    CorrespondingPoint {
        object_point: [1., 2., 3.],
        image_point: [420.300, 440.600],
    },
    CorrespondingPoint {
        object_point: [1.1, 2.2, 3.3],
        image_point: [430.330, 460.660],
    },
    CorrespondingPoint {
        object_point: [4., 5., 6.],
        image_point: [720.600, 741.200],
    },
    CorrespondingPoint {
        object_point: [4.4, 5.5, 6.6],
        image_point: [760.660, 791.320],
    },
    CorrespondingPoint {
        object_point: [7., 8., 9.],
        image_point: [1020.900, 1041.800],
    },
    CorrespondingPoint {
        object_point: [7.7, 8.8, 9.9],
        image_point: [1090.990, 1121.980],
    },
];

let pmat = dlt_corresponding(&points, 1e-10).unwrap();
let cam = Camera::from_perspective_matrix(&pmat).unwrap();
for orig in points.iter() {
    let world = Points::new(nalgebra::RowVector3::from_row_slice(&orig.object_point));
    let px = cam.world_to_pixel(&world);
    approx::assert_relative_eq!(px.data.as_slice(), &orig.image_point[..], epsilon = 1e-4);
}
```
